 * Re-vendored into Orbit from the copy in the owner's BitChord app, which had already
 * merged the KMP expect/actual declarations into one Android source set and added the
 * backdrop resolution scale. Orbit's changes: the package is renamed, and the IDE-only
 * @Language("AGSL") annotations are dropped so the sources need no annotations artifact.
